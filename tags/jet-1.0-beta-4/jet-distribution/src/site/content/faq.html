    <h1>General Use</h1>

    <h2>Why JET - yet another open-source econometrics library?</h2>
        <p>
        While it is true that there are several open-source econometrics libraries available, most notably
    	<a href="http://gretl.sf.net">GRETL</a>, none of these were written in Java, thus making the integration in Java
    	applications very cumbersome (and nullifying the benefit of cross-platform portability).  
    	</p>
        <p>
        JET aims to be easily embeddable in any Java application and the user can pick and choose the module
        which are most convenient from the toolkit.
        </p>
    	<p>
    	Another important differentiator of JET is that is released under a <a href="license.html">Apache 2.0</a> license,
    	and not under <a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GPL</a>, thus making it much more 
    	commercially-friendly.
        </p>

    <h1>System requirements</h1>

    <h2>Which Java version is required to use JET?</h2>
    <p>1.5 (aka Java 5.0) or later.  <a href="http://www.java.com/getjava/">Get Java</a> for your platform.</p>
